This is just a simple app I use to load a browser pointed at localhost with a specific port


You can call it like this:

llwp 3000 test

That will load you browser and point to http://localhost:3000/test

the port and subfolders are optional

llwp

will load a browser pointed at http://localhost/

I built this for myself but if you want to extend it feel free to msg me

On ruby gems as well: https://rubygems.org/gems/llwp
